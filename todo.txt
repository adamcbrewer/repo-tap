TODO LIST
==========================

// URGENT



// NEXT UP

- 	pre-compile templte file. If exists then use pre-compiled one.
- 	track if user has been sent the latest commits
- 	sort commits in the server stack when a user loads the page.
	> 	this isn't needed any other time as new commits are automatically pre-pended
		when sent to client in real time.


// LESS IMPORTANT

- 	moment.js for better time reading
- 	display number of connected clients
	> 	set up routes/paths for sockets
- 	display a countdown until the next check


// FUTURE

- 	repo link displays page with all commits from that repo
- 	fetch users' avatar
