TODO LIST
==========================

// URGENT



// NEXT UP

- 	pre-compile templte file. If exists then use pre-compiled one.
- 	track if user has been sent the latest commits
- 	sort commits in the server stack when a user loads the page.
	> 	this isn't needed any other time as new commits are automatically pre-pended
		when sent to client in real time. Only needed when the page is loaded.


// LESS IMPORTANT

- 	process uptime (convert to minutes)
- 	process memory usage

// FUTURE

- 	repo link displays page with all commits from that repo
- 	fetch users' avatar
