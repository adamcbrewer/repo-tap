TODO LIST
==========================

// URGENT

- 	delete clients when disconnect
- 	socket.io through same port as express


// LESS IMPORTANT

- 	extra data in template file
- 	pre-compile templte file. If exists then use pre-compiled one.
- 	sort commits in the server stack when a user loads the page.
	> 	this isn't needed any other time as new commits are automatically pre-pended
		when sent to client in real time.


// FUTURE

- 	track if user has been sent the latest commits
